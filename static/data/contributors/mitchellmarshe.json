  "bio": "Born in Sparks, Nevada, on August 20, 1993. I moved to Austin, Texas with my family in 2005. For most of my high school career, I focused on the studies of architecture. In 2012, I graduated from Stony Point High School and enrolled to Austin Community College where I obtained an Associate of General Education in Applied Sciences. Soon after, I enrolled to the University of Texas at Austin, where I am currently a Student of Computer Science, Software Engineering under Electrical Engineering, and Architectural History. Today, I work hard in my endeavors and I am well supported by my family, friends, and colleagues. I give much thanks to my loving wife, Kaidence, and our two cats, Socks & Buttercup for their love, encouragement, and understanding.",
