GameFrame is an open-source online database containing video games and their
associated publishers, developers, news articles, videos, and tweets. This 
information is conveniently organized into pages similar to IMDb where related 
entities are readily accessible from one another. Games can be filtered and 
sorted according to name, genre, number of related videos, and many more 
interesting criteria.<br>

<br>In addition to providing high quality information and media on thousands 
of games, GameFrame analyzes relationships and metadata to obtain statistics 
on a game's visibility and popularity. This information can be used to answer 
questions like: "What bad games have too much publicity?", "What good games 
deserve more publicity?", and "What are the most popular genres, tags, 
etc?".<br>

<br>Everything on GameFrame is publicly available through a convenient REST 
API. For more information, see the 
<a href="https://cilki.gitbooks.io/api/">API documentation</a>.
We hope this site is helpful to those wanting to browse through detailed 
information on many games from diverse platforms, backgrounds, and time 
periods.
