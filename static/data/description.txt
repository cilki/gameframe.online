This project was born out of all of our love of video games. It connects games to their developers and news articles to both games and developers. The purpose is to get as much data as possible about a game in the same place. We hope the site will be used by others like us with the same love of gaming and thirst for knowledge.\nBy choosing these three models, we will eventually (in later phases) be able to determine a notion of popularity of different games by combining metrics such as Steam ratings, number of tweets, YouTube videos, Twitch streams, etc. This will give us insight as to where the industry might be heading next, as well as information on how scandals such as the recent rise of microtransactions in games such as Destiny 2 and Star Wars Battlefront II.
