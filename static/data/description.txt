GameFrame is an open-source online database containing video games and their
associated publishers, developers, news articles, videos, and tweets. This
information is conveniently organized into pages similar to IMDb where related
entities are readily accessible from one another. Games can be filtered and
sorted according to name, genre, number of related videos, and many more
interesting criteria.<br>

<br>In addition to providing high quality information and media on thousands
of games, GameFrame analyzes relationships and metadata to obtain statistics
on a game's visibility and popularity. This information can be used to answer
questions like: "What bad games have too much publicity?", "What good games
deserve more publicity?", and "What are the most popular genres, tags,
etc?".<br>

<br>The GameFrame dataset is an aggregation of video game data from <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API">Steam</a>
and <a href="https://www.igdb.com/api">The Internet Game Database</a>, news data
from <a href="https://newsapi.org">NewsAPI</a> and <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API">Steam</a>,
video data from <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs">YouTube</a>,
and tweet data from <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs">Twitter</a>.
Each source was thoroughly scraped using GET requests into a local cache, about
30 GB in total, and then sanitized, filtered, and merged into the final database.
Everything on GameFrame is publicly available through our convenient REST
API. For usage information, see the <a href="https://cilki.gitbooks.io/api/">API
documentation</a>. We hope this site is helpful to those wanting to browse through
detailed information on tons games from diverse platforms, backgrounds, and time
periods.
