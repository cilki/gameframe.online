+++

### What We Did Well

- Met at least once a week
- Communicated consistently
- Stayed on top of GitHub issues
- Gathered and organized a large amount of data
- Effectively distributed the workload

+++

### What We Learned

- Using libraries makes life easier
- Write more test-friendly code
- Developing for multiple browsers and devices can be a challenge
- How to connect disparate data
  - Video games, articles, tweets, YouTube videos...

+++

### What We Could Do Better

- Set up our testing framework earlier
- Come up with an initial design plan
- Fix ESLint errors earlier (coding styles)
- Make the carousel dynamic

+++

### What Still Puzzles Us

- Good testing practices
- Mystery performance issues
- Microsoft Edge issues
  - Spaces in URLs
  - CSS support
  - Web driver bug

## The Working Men Critique

+++

### What They Did Well

- They improved their 'about' page design considerably
- Their dataset was unique
- They addressed our user stories in a timely fashion
- The graphs on their instance pages were very attractive
- Their site is fast

+++

### What We Learned From Them

- They found a filtering bug on our website
- Use graphs to visualize data
- Use GitHub issues more
 - They had over 100 closed issues

+++

### What They Could Do Better

- *Don't* commit database credentials
- *Don't* commit `node_modules`
- Add instance summaries
- Make site mobile friendly

+++

### What Still Puzzles Us

- Do people want to know the physician-population ratio?
- Why do the instance headers link to the thumbnail images?
  - Why isn't the thumbnail itself on the instance page?
- Why couldn't they fix the image scaling?
