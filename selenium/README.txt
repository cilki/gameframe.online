Drivers are for Windows machines. 

If someone can figure out how to test Safari on Windows, please tell me because the documentation (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) does not work for me. 

To run the acceptance tests, make sure you have Chrome, Edge, and Firefox installed. Then navigate in the terminal to the selenium folder. Finally, run the TestSite.py file with Python3, sit back and wait about fifteen minutes, and check the results.
