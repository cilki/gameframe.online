To run the acceptance tests, make sure you have Chrome, Edge, and Firefox installed. 
Also have the webdrivers for each installed and in your PATH as well (see: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html). 
With Pip3, you also need to install the selenium package. 
Then navigate in the terminal to the selenium folder. 
Finally, run the TestSite.py file with Python3, sit back and wait about ten minutes, and check the results.
